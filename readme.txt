 COLLEGE BUS PASS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Project Description
College Bus Pass Management System is an online web application that allows the students to apply for college bus pass.
The main aim of this project is to provide the students to book their bus pass online from home instead of waiting in long queues in the college. 
Also, this would save a lot of time for both students as well as the college office staffs and also with more efficiently. 
This Project also solves the problems for students carrying a hard copy of bus pass as they can get a pdf copy of their bus pass only after they successfully filled and submitted 
the bus application form. 

Purpose and Goals
Purpose
This web application was developed as a mini project for database management system. This mini project helped us in understanding how to integrate the modules into one 
working application. This mini project also made us familiar with the issues that occur during the integration of modules in real software projects like following 
consistent database schema, variable names etc.
